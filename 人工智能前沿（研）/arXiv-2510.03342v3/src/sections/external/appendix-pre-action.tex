In this section, we provide additional material to supplement the results for \grshortlatest{}. 

\subsection{Rank consistency between
evaluations in simulation and on real robots}
\label{sec:sim-to-real-appendix}

We leverage physics-based simulators to massively scale up the evaluations of our \grshortlatest{} models for new objects, scenes, and environments. \cref{fig:sim_to_real_correlation} demonstrates the rank consistency between our MuJoCo simulator-based evaluation and real-robot evaluations across multiple scenes and tasks, which enables us to rapidly iterate on architectural and algorithmic improvements while reducing the need to conduct slow real-robot evaluations.

\subsection{Generalization benchmark}
\label{appendix:generalization-tasks}
\subsubsection{ALOHA robot}
Our generalization benchmark expands the benchmark defined in~\cite{team2025gemini} (68 generalization tasks) with a new set of action generalization tasks (5 tasks) and a new category to measure generalization to entirely new tasks (12 tasks). See~\cite{team2025gemini} for details about previous Visual, Instruction and Action generalization tasks. To measure performance in-distribution we use the dexterity benchmark defined in Section 3.2 of ~\cite{team2025gemini} (20 tasks).  Progress score definition for in-distribution, visual, semantic and action generalization can also be found in \cite{team2025gemini}.  

\paragraph{New action generalization progress score definition}
\label{appendix:new-action-gen-aloha}

The action generalization benchmark defined in prior work~\cite{team2025gemini} largely focused on measuring the model's ability to handle new object locations and shape variants. We expand the benchmark further to include tasks that require the policy to compose multiple learned motions in novel ways to solve new tasks. For example, having seen data of the robot pushing objects for a short distance at different locations, the 'drink-pushing' task (Figure \ref{fig:action-gen-tasks}) measures how well the policy can combine them together to push a novel object all the way from bottom of the table to the top edge. Table \ref{tab:aloha_action_gen} lists the definition of progress scores for each task.

\subsubsection{Bi-arm Franka robot}

We defined a new generalization benchmark for our Bi-arm Franka robot. This benchmark includes a total of 44 tasks, 20 of those in distribution and 24 including variants of them across different axes: instruction, visual and action generalization, following the same approach we used to define the ALOHA robot benchmark in ~\cite{team2025gemini}. For the task generalization category we used the same 12 tasks and progress score described in \ref{appendix:task-gen-aloha} for ALOHA. It is worth noting that the the Bi-arm Franka benchmark also includes highly dexterous tasks such as NIST  Board 2 assembly tasks and insertion of cables in a workstation and sockets.

The Bi-arm Franka robot benchmark is defined across three different scenes (Figure \ref{fig:omega-scenes}):
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{src/assets/actions/gr1.5_appendix_omega_in_dist_scenes.pdf}
    \caption{Scenes used to define the generalization benchmark for Bi-Arm Franka robot. Left: A workbench inspired scene that allows for manipulation of tools and skills ranging from hanging, unhanging, picking and placing. Center: a scene with a computer and assorted cables and peripherals, allowing for cable handling, insertions and removals. Left: Layout of the National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST) Task Board 2 ~\cite{nistassemblyboards}. 
    \label{fig:omega-scenes}}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Workbench:} this scene spans both table-top manipulation tasks and interaction with the vertical back panel, which allows for manipulation of tools and skills ranging from hanging, unhanging, picking and placing.
\item \textbf{Computer scene:} this scene requires interacting with real-world computer, cables and peripherals that involves dexterous and precise tasks such as cable handling, insertions and removals.
\item \textbf{NIST Assembly Board 2:} based on the Task Assembly Board 2 as defined by NIST, this scene presents complex and precise assembly and removal of the three belts present.
\end{itemize}


Figure \ref{fig:example_of_gen_omega} shows examples of task variations to measure instruction, visual and semantic generalization on the Bi-arm Franka robot.

\paragraph{Task progress score for in-distribution, visual and action generalization tasks}
We now define the task progress score for each task in the generalization benchmark for Bi-arm Franka robot.

\subsubsection{Apollo humanoid robot}
We defined a new generalization benchmark for our Apollo humanoid robot. This benchmark includes a total of 24 tasks,  of those in distribution and  including variants of them across different axes: instruction, visual and action generalization, following the same approach we used to define the ALOHA robot benchmark in ~\cite{team2025gemini}. For the task generalization category we used the same tasks described in \ref{appendix:task-gen-aloha} for ALOHA.

Figure \ref{fig:example_of_gen_atari} shows examples of task variations to measure instruction, visual and semantic generalization on the Apollo humanoid robot.

\paragraph{Qualitative Results}

Controlling a humanoid is much more challenging than the Aloha or the bi-arm Franka robots, due to higher degree-of-freedom whole-body control, multi-finger dexterity, and limited visibility of the workspace that requires active perception. \cref{fig:humanoid_gen_images} shows qualitative examples which demonstrate remarkable degrees of generalization of \grlatest{} on the humanoid platform.  We observe that our model can control Apollo to grasp novel objects and place them into receptacles that were not seen in the training data. Depending on the objects to manipulate, different grasping strategies emerge automatically. Furthermore, we also observe successful object manipulation on surfaces with different heights that were not seen during training as well.

\subsection{Cross-embodiment benchmark}
\label{appendix:cross-embodiment-benchmark}

In order to measure Motion Transfer across our three robots we define benchmarks for testing tasks on a Robot A for which data was only collected on Robot B and vice-versa. We focus on the following scenarios.

\subsubsection{Bi-arm Franka \texorpdfstring{$\to$}{->} ALOHA benchmark}
The ALOHA robot data is diverse and enables the execution of a multitude of tasks as demonstrated in our prior work \cite{team2025gemini}. However, the vast majority of this data focuses on table top tasks with limited interaction on the vertical axis. Meanwhile for Bi-arm Franka robot we have collected data involving interacting with a vertically mounted back-panel that goes beyond the typical motion range for ALOHA. As such, tasks in this scenario (e.g. hanging/unhanging tools) provide an ideal benchmark for motion transfer as a model trained with solely ALOHA data cannot solve them. Following this strategy, we design a set of 10 tasks in this benchmark. Figure {\ref{fig:omega2aloha-images}} provides a visual overview of the tasks and Table \ref{tab:franka_to_aloha_benchmark} provides the progress score definition for each task.

\subsubsection{ALOHA benchmark \texorpdfstring{$\to$}{->} Bi-arm Franka and Apollo humanoid robot \texorpdfstring{$\to$}{->} Bi-arm Franka}
We identified in the ALOHA data tasks that require specific motions such as open drawers or closing a pear-shaped organizer (task that requires precise control) which are not available in the Bi-arm Franka data. In addition we  added some easier packing tasks to see whether motion transfer could not only transfer new skills but also improves  performance on easier tasks. We followed a similar procedure to define the tasks to measure motion transfer from the Humanoid robot to the Bi-arm Franka. Figure \ref{fig:aloha2omega-images} and \ref{fig:atari2omega-images} provides a visual overview of the tasks (11 in total) and Table \ref{tab:cross_emb_to_franka} provides the progress score definition for each task.

\subsubsection{ALOHA benchmark \texorpdfstring{$\to$}{->} Humanoid robot}
We followed a similar approach for the Humanoid robot: we looked into skills in the ALOHA dataset that are not covered by the action data for the Humanoid. One example to highlight this is the task "open the wardrobe", which is a motor skill completely outside the covergae of the Humanoid dataset. Fig \ref{fig:atari-cross-images} shows visuals of the 7 tasks in this benchmark and Table \ref{tab:aloha_to_humanoid_benchmark} reports the definition of the progress score for each task.

\subsection{Multi-step benchmark}
\label{appendix:medium-horizon-benchmark}

The multi-step benchmarks combine individual tasks into compound instructions (i.e., A then B then C) or abstract, goal-oriented instructions. For the compound instructions, we typically require a particular order for the individual tasks in order to achieve a full score of 1.0. For example, for the Apollo humanoid, several of our multi-step tasks combine individual gift packing tasks into compound instructions such as "put the stress ball in the white bag, then put the gummy bear bag in the white bag, then put the white socks in the white bag" and require this exact order for a perfect score. We also include abstract, goal-oriented instructions such as ``pack all the gifts'' or ``sort the snacks into their matching containers by color'', though these are less common across the benchmarks. The next paragraphs show the tasks and their progress score system for each embodiment.

\subsubsection{ALOHA robot}
Figure \ref{fig:medium-horizon-aloha} shows visuals of the tasks and Table \ref{tab:aloha_medium_horizon} defines the progress score for each task.
