# eightpuzzle with QT GUI
This is a simple demo A-star algorithm auto-solver for [eightpuzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle) games. I added a QT GUI to it. *Please notice that this project has been archived for several years and no more updates.*

Since it has been my course project, I DO NOT recommend you to submit for your own course.
